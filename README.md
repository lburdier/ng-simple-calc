Voici la version parfaite avec toutes les informations intégrées en Markdown et respectant les règles pour les commandes `bash` :

# Calculatrice

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.

## Features
- A functional calculator built with Angular
- Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Modern dark mode design
- Real-time input validation with error messages
- Responsive UI

## Development server
To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building
To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests
To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Deployment
To deploy the application to a hosting platform, you can use the production build:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

Upload the contents of the `dist/` directory to your preferred hosting provider.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before working on the project:

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- Angular CLI (v14 or later)
- Git (optional, for version control)

To install Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
